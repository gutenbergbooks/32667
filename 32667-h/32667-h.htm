<p>It all began on a Saturday
night at <i>The Space Room</i>. If
you've seen any recent Martian
travel folders, you know the place:
"A picturesque oasis of old Martian
charm, situated on the beauteous
Grand Canal in the heart of
Marsport. Only half a mile from
historic Chandler Field, landing
site of the first Martian expedition
nearly fifty years ago in 1990. A
visitor to the hotel, lunch room or
cocktail lounge will thrill at the
sight of hardy space pioneers mingling
side by side with colorful
Martian tribesmen. An evening at
<i>The Space Room</i> is an amazing,
unforgettable experience."</p>

<p>Of course, the folders neglect to
add that the most amazing aspect is
the scent of the Canal's stagnant
water&mdash;and that the most unforgettable
experience is seeing the "root-of-all-evil"
evaporate from your
pocketbook like snow from the
Great Red Desert.</p>

<p>We were sitting on the bandstand
of the candle-lit cocktail lounge.
Me&mdash;Jimmie Stanley&mdash;and my
four-piece combo. Maybe you've
seen our motto back on Earth:
"The Hottest Music This Side of
Mercury."</p>

<p>But there weren't four of us tonight.
Only three. Ziggy, our bass
fiddle man, had nearly sliced off
two fingers while opening a can of
Saturnian ice-fish, thus decreasing
the number of our personnel by a
tragic twenty-five per cent.</p>

<p>Which was why Ke-teeli, our
boss, was descending upon us with
all the grace of an enraged Venusian
vinosaur.</p>

<p>"Where ees museek?" he shrilled
in his nasal tenor. He was almost
skeleton thin, like most Martians,
and so tall that if he fell down he'd
be half way home.</p>

<p>I gulped. "Our bass man can't
be here, but we've called the Marsport
local for another. He'll be here
any minute."</p>

<p>Ke-teeli, sometimes referred to
as Goon-Face and The Eye, leered
coldly down at me from his eight-foot-three.
His eyes were like black
needle points set deep in a mask of
dry, ancient, reddish leather.</p>

<p>"Ees no feedle man, ees no job,"
he squeaked.</p>

<p>I sighed. This was the week our
contract ended. Goon-Face had displayed
little enough enthusiasm for
our music as it was. His comments
were either, "Ees too loud, too fast,"
or "Ees too slow, too soft." The real
cause of his concern being, I suspected,
the infrequency with which
his cash register tinkled.</p>

<p>"But," I added, "even if the new
man doesn't come, <i>we're</i> still here.
We'll play for you." I glanced at
the conglomeration of uniformed
spacemen, white-suited tourists,
and loin-clothed natives who sat at
ancient stone tables. "You wouldn't
want to disappoint your customers,
would you?"</p>

<p>Ke-teeli snorted. "Maybe ees better
dey be deesappointed. Ees better
no museek den bad museek."</p>

<p>Fat Boy, our clarinetist who doubles
on Martian horn-harp, made a
feeble attempt at optimism. "Don't
worry, Mr. Ke-teeli. That new bass
man will be here."</p>

<p>"Sure," said Hammer-Head, our
red-haired vibro-drummer. "I think
I hear him coming now."</p>

<p>Suspiciously, Ke-teeli eyed the
entrance. There was only silence.
His naked, parchment-like chest
swelled as if it were an expanding
balloon.</p>

<p>"Five meenutes!" he shrieked.
"Eef no feedle, den you go!" And
he whirled away.</p>

<p>We waited.</p>

<p>Fat Boy's two hundred and
eighty-odd pounds were drooped
over his chair like the blubber of an
exhausted, beach-stranded whale.</p>

<p>"Well," he muttered, "there's always
the uranium pits of Neptune.
Course, you don't live more than
five years there&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Maybe we could make it back
to Lunar City," suggested Hammer-Head.</p>

<p>"Using what for fare?" I asked.
"Your brains?"</p>

<p>Hammer-Head groaned. "No. I
guess it'll have to be the black pits
of Neptune. The home of washed-up
interplanetary musicians. It's too
bad. We're so young, too."</p>

<p>The seconds swept by. Ke-teeli
was casting his razor-edged glare in
our direction. I brushed the chewed
finger nails from the keyboard of
my electronic piano.</p>

<p>Then it happened.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>From the entrance of <i>The
Space Room</i> came a thumping
and a grating and a banging. Suddenly,
sweeping across the dance
floor like a cold wind, was a bass
fiddle, an enormous black monstrosity,
a refugee from a pawnbroker's
attic. It was queerly shaped. It was
too tall, too wide. It was more like
a monstrous, midnight-black hour-glass
than a bass.</p>

<p>The fiddle was not unaccompanied
as I'd first imagined. Behind
it, streaking over the floor in a
waltz of agony, was a little guy, an
animated matchstick with a flat,
broad face that seemed to have
been compressed in a vice. His sandcolored
mop of hair reminded me
of a field of dry grass, the long
strands forming loops that flanked
the sides of his face.</p>

<p>His pale blue eyes were watery,
like twin pools of fog. His tightfitting
suit, as black as the bass,
was something off a park bench. It
was impossible to guess his age. He
could have been anywhere between
twenty and forty.</p>

<p>The bass thumped down upon
the bandstand.</p>

<p>"Hello," he puffed. "I'm John
Smith, from the Marsport union."
He spoke shrilly and rapidly, as if
anxious to conclude the routine of
introductions. "I'm sorry I'm late,
but I was working on my plan."</p>

<p>A moment's silence.</p>

<p>"Your plan?" I echoed at last.</p>

<p>"How to get back home," he
snapped as if I should have known
it already.</p>

<p>Hummm, I thought.</p>

<p>My gaze turned to the dance
floor. Goon-Face had his eyes on
us, and they were as cold as six Indians
going South.</p>

<p>"We'll talk about your plan at
intermission," I said, shivering.
"Now, we'd better start playing.
John, do you know <i>On An Asteroid
With You</i>?"</p>

<p>"I know <i>everything</i>," said John
Smith.</p>

<p>I turned to my piano with a
shudder. I didn't dare look at that
horrible fiddle again. I didn't dare
think what kind of soul-chilling
tones might emerge from its ancient
depths.</p>

<p>And I didn't dare look again at
the second monstrosity, the one
named John Smith. I closed my
eyes and plunged into a four-bar
intro.</p>

<p>Hammer-Head joined in on
vibro-drums and Fat Boy on clarinet,
and then&mdash;</p>

<p>My eyes burst open. A shiver
coursed down my spine like gigantic
mice feet.</p>

<p>The tones that surged from that
monstrous bass were ecstatic. They
were out of a jazzman's Heaven.
They were great rolling clouds that
seemed to envelop the entire universe
with their vibrance. They
held a depth and a volume and a
richness that were astounding, that
were like no others I'd ever heard.</p>

<p>First they went <i>Boom-de-boom-de-boom-de-boom</i>,
and then, <i>boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom-de-de-boom</i>,
just like the tones of all bass
fiddles.</p>

<p>But there was something else, too.
There were overtones, so that John
wasn't just playing a single note,
but a whole chord with each beat.
And the fullness, the depth of those
incredible chords actually set my
blood tingling. I could <i>feel</i> the
tingling just as one can feel the vibration
of a plucked guitar string.</p>

<p>I glanced at the cash customers.
They looked like weary warriors
getting their first glimpse of Valhalla.
Gap-jawed and wide-eyed,
they seemed in a kind of ecstatic
hypnosis. Even the silent, bland-faced
Martians stopped sipping
their wine-syrup and nodded their
dark heads in time with the rhythm.</p>

<p>I looked at The Eye. The transformation
of his gaunt features
was miraculous. Shadows of gloom
dissolved and were replaced by
a black-toothed, crescent-shaped
smile of delight. His eyes shone like
those of a kid seeing Santa Claus.</p>

<p>We finished <i>On An Asteroid With
You</i>, modulated into <i>Sweet Sally
from Saturn</i> and finished with
<i>Tighten Your Lips on Titan</i>.</p>

<p>We waited for the applause of
the Earth people and the shrilling
of the Martians to die down. Then
I turned to John and his fiddle.</p>

<p>"If I didn't hear it," I gasped,
"I wouldn't believe it!"</p>

<p>"And the fiddle's so old, too!"
added Hammer-Head who, although
sober, seemed quite drunk.</p>

<p>"Old?" said John Smith. "Of
course it's old. It's over five thousand
years old. I was lucky to find
it in a pawnshop. Only it's not a
fiddle but a <i>Zloomph</i>. This is the
only one in existence." He patted
the thing tenderly. "I tried the hole
in it but it isn't the right one."</p>

<p>I wondered what the hell he was
talking about. I studied the black,
mirror-like wood. The aperture in
the vesonator was like that of any
bass fiddle.</p>

<p>"Isn't right for what?" I had to
ask.</p>

<p>He turned his sad eyes to me.
"For going home," he said.</p>

<p>Hummm, I thought.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>We played. Tune after tune.
John knew them all, from the
latest pop melodies to a swing version
of the classic <i>Rhapsody of The
Stars</i>. He was a quiet guy during
the next couple of hours, and getting
more than a few words from
him seemed as hard as extracting a
tooth. He'd stand by his fiddle&mdash;I
mean, his <i>Zloomph</i>&mdash;with a dreamy
expression in those watery eyes,
staring at nothing.</p>

<p>But after one number he studied
Fat Boy's clarinet for a moment.
"Nice clarinet," he mused. "Has an
unusual hole in the front."</p>

<p>Fat Boy scratched the back of
his head. "You&mdash;you mean here?
Where the music comes out?"</p>

<p>John Smith nodded. "Unusual."</p>

<p>Hummm, I thought again.</p>

<p>Awhile later I caught him eyeing
my piano keyboard. "What's
the matter, John?"</p>

<p>He pointed.</p>

<p>"Oh, there," I said. "A cigarette
fell out of my ashtray, burnt a hole
in the key. If The Eye sees it, he'll
swear at me in seven languages."</p>

<p>"Even there," he said softly,
"even there...."</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it.
John Smith was peculiar, but he
was the best bass man this side of a
musician's Nirvana.</p>

<p>It didn't take a genius to figure
out our situation. Item one: Goon-Face's
countenance had evidenced
an excellent imitation of Mephistopheles
before John began to play.
Item two: Goon-Face had beamed
like a kitten with a quart of cream
after John began to play.</p>

<p>Conclusion: If we wanted to
keep eating, we'd have to persuade
John Smith to join our combo.</p>

<p>At intermission I said, "How
about a drink, John? Maybe a shot
of wine-syrup?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"Then maybe a Venusian fizz?"</p>

<p>His grunt was negative.</p>

<p>"Then some old-fashioned beer?"</p>

<p>He smiled. "Yes, I <i>like</i> beer."</p>

<p>I escorted him to the bar and assisted
him in his arduous climb onto
a stool.</p>

<p>"John," I ventured after he'd
taken an experimental sip, "where
have you been hiding? A guy like
you should be playing every night."</p>

<p>John yawned. "Just got here. Figured
I might need some money so
I went to the union. Then I worked
on my plan."</p>

<p>"Then you need a job. How
about playing with us steady? We
like your style a lot."</p>

<p>He made a long, low humming
sound which I interpreted as an
expression of intense concentration.
"I don't know," he finally drawled.</p>

<p>"It'd be a steady job, John." Inspiration
struck me. "And listen, I
have an apartment. It's got everything,
solar shower, automatic chef,
'copter landing&mdash;if we ever get a
'copter. Plenty of room there for
two people. You can stay with me
and it won't cost you a cent. And
we'll even pay you over union
wages."</p>

<p>His watery gaze wandered lazily
to the bar mirror, down to the glittering
array of bottles and then out
to the dance floor.</p>

<p>He yawned again and spoke
slowly, as if each word were a leaden
weight cast reluctantly from his
tongue:</p>

<p>"No, I don't ... care much ...
about playing."</p>

<p>"What <i>do</i> you like to do, John?"</p>

<p>His string-bean of a body stiffened.
"I like to study ancient history ...
and I must work on my
plan."</p>

<p>Oh Lord, that plan again!</p>

<p>I took a deep breath. "Tell me
about it, John. It <i>must</i> be interesting."</p>

<p>He made queer clicking noises
with his mouth that reminded me
of a mechanical toy being wound
into motion. "The whole foundation
of this or any other culture is
based on the history of all the time
dimensions, each interwoven with
the other, throughout the ages. And
the holes provide a means of studying
all of it first hand."</p>

<p><i>Oh, oh</i>, I thought. <i>But you still
have to eat. Remember, you still
have to eat.</i></p>

<p>"Trouble is," he went on, "there
are so many holes in this universe."</p>

<p>"Holes?" I kept a straight face.</p>

<p>"Certainly. Look around you. All
you see is holes. These beer bottles
are just holes surrounded by glass.
The doors and windows&mdash;they're
holes in walls. The mine tunnels
make a network of holes under the
desert. Caves are holes, animals live
in holes, our faces have holes,
clothes have holes&mdash;millions and
millions of holes!"</p>

<p>I winced and thought, humor
him because you gotta eat, you
gotta eat.</p>

<p>His voice trembled with emotion.
"Why, they're everywhere. They're
in pots and pans, in pipes, in rocket
jets, in bumpy roads. There are buttonholes
and well holes, and shoelace
holes. There are doughnut
holes and stocking holes and woodpecker
holes and cheese holes.
Oceans lie in holes in the earth,
and rivers and canals and valleys.
The craters of the Moon are holes.
Everything is&mdash;"</p>

<p>"But, John," I said as patiently as
possible, "what have these holes
got to do with you?"</p>

<p>He glowered at me as if I were
unworthy of such a confidence.
"What have they to do with me?"
he shrilled. "I can't find the right
one&mdash;that's what!"</p>

<p>I closed my eyes. "Which particular
hole are you looking for, John?"</p>

<p>He was speaking rapidly again
now.</p>

<p>"I was hurrying back to the University
with the <i>Zloomph</i> to prove
a point of ancient history to those
fools. They don't believe that instruments
which make music actually
existed before the tapes! It
was dark&mdash;and some fool researcher
had forgotten to set a force-field
over the hole&mdash;I fell through."</p>

<p>I closed my eyes. "Now wait a
minute. Did you drop something,
lose it in the hole&mdash;is that why you
have to find it?"</p>

<p>"Oh I didn't lose anything important,"
he snapped, "<i>just</i> my own
time dimension. And if I don't get
back they will think I couldn't prove
my theory, that I'm ashamed to
come back, and I'll be discredited."</p>

<p>His chest sagged for an instant.
Then he straightened. "But there's
still time for my plan to work out&mdash;with
the relative difference taken
into account. Only I get so tired
just thinking about it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I can see where thinking
about it would tire any one."</p>

<p>He nodded. "But it can't be too
far away."</p>

<p>"I'd like to hear more about it,"
I said. "But if you're not going to
play with us&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, I'll play with you," he
beamed. "I can talk to <i>you</i>. <i>You</i>
understand."</p>

<p>Thank heaven!</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Heaven lasted for just three
days. During those seventy-two
golden hours the melodious tinkling
of The Eye's cash register was as
constant as that of Santa's sleigh
bells.</p>

<p>John became the hero of tourists,
spacemen, and Martians, but nevertheless
he remained stubbornly
aloof. He was quiet, moody, playing
his <i>Zloomph</i> automatically. He'd
reveal definite indications of belonging
to Homo Sapiens only when
drinking beer and talking about his
holes.</p>

<p>Goon-Face was still cautious.</p>

<p>"Contract?" he wheezed. "Maybe.
We see. Eef feedleman stay, we
have contract. He stay, yes?"</p>

<p>"Oh, sure," I said. "He'll stay&mdash;just
as long as you want him."</p>

<p>"Den he sign contract, too. No
beeg feedle, no contract."</p>

<p>"Sure. We'll get him to sign it."
I laughed hollowly. "Don't worry,
Mr. Ke-teeli."</p>

<p>Just a few minutes later tragedy
struck.</p>

<p>A reporter from the <i>Marsport
Times</i> ambled into interview the
Man of The Hour. The interview,
unfortunately, was conducted over
the bar and accompanied by a generous
guzzling of beer. Fat Boy,
Hammer-Head and I watched
from a table. Knowing John as we
did, a silent prayer was in our eyes.</p>

<p>"This is the first time he's talked
to anybody," Fat Boy breathed.
"I&mdash;I'm scared.</p>

<p>"Nothing can happen," I said,
optimistically. "This'll be good publicity."</p>

<p>We watched.</p>

<p>John murmured something. The
reporter, a paunchy, balding man,
scribbled furiously in his notebook.</p>

<p>John yawned, muttered something
else. The reporter continued
to scribble.</p>

<p>John sipped beer. His eyes
brightened, and he began to talk
more rapidly.</p>

<p>The reporter frowned, stopped
writing, and studied John curiously.</p>

<p>John finished his first beer,
started on his second. His eyes were
wild, and he was talking more and
more rapidly.</p>

<p>"He's doing it," Hammer-Head
groaned. "He's telling him!"</p>

<p>I rose swiftly. "We better get
over there. We should have known
better&mdash;"</p>

<p>We were too late. The reporter
had already slapped on his hat and
was striding to the exit. John turned
to us, dazed, his enthusiasm vanishing
like air from a punctured balloon.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't listen," he said,
weakly. "I tried to tell him, but he
said he'd come back when I'm
sober. I'm sober now. So I quit.
I've got to find my hole."</p>

<p>I patted him on the back. "No,
John, we'll help you. Don't quit.
We'll&mdash;well, we'll help you."</p>

<p>"We're working on a plan, too,"
said Fat Boy in a burst of inspiration.
"We're going to make a more
scientific approach."</p>

<p>"How?" John asked.</p>

<p>Fat Boy gulped.</p>

<p>"Just wait another day," I said.
"We'll have it worked out. Just be
patient another day. You can't
leave now, not after all your work."</p>

<p>"No, I guess not," he sighed. "I'll
stay&mdash;until tomorrow."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>All night the thought crept
through my brain like a teasing
spider: <i>What can we do to make
him stay? What can we tell him?
What, what, what?</i></p>

<p>Unable to sleep the next morning,
I left John to his snoring and
went for an aspirin and black coffee.
All the possible schemes were
drumming through my mind: finding
an Earth blonde to capture
John's interest, having him electro-hypnotized,
breaking his leg, forging
a letter from this mythical university
telling him his theory was
proved valid and for him to take
a nice long vacation now. He was
a screwball about holes and force
fields and dimensional worlds but
for that music of his I'd baby him
the rest of his life.</p>

<p>It was early afternoon when I
trudged back to my apartment.</p>

<p>John was squatting on the living
room floor, surrounded by a forest
of empty beer bottles. His eyes were
bulging, his hair was even wilder
than usual, and he was swaying.</p>

<p>"John!" I cried. "You're drunk!"</p>

<p>His watery eyes squinted at me.
"No, not drunk. Just scared. I'm
awful scared!"</p>

<p>"But you mustn't be scared. That
reporter was just stupid. We'll help
you with your theory."</p>

<p>His body trembled. "No, it isn't
that. It isn't the reporter."</p>

<p>"Then what is it, John?"</p>

<p>"It's my body. It's&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, what about your body?
Are you sick?"</p>

<p>His face was white with terror.
"No, my&mdash;<i>my body's full of holes</i>.
Suppose it's one of those holes!
How will I get back if it is?"</p>

<p>He rose and staggered to his
<i>Zloomph</i>, clutching it as though it
were somehow a source of strength
and consolation.</p>

<p>I patted him gingerly on the arm.
"Now John. You've just had too
much beer, that's all. Let's go out
and get some air and some strong
black coffee. C'mon now."</p>

<p>We staggered out into the morning
darkness, the three of us. John,
the <i>Zloomph</i>, and I.</p>

<p>I was hanging on to him trying
to see around and over and even
under the <i>Zloomph</i>&mdash;steering by a
sort of radar-like sixth sense. The
street lights on Marsport are pretty
dim compared to Earthside. I
didn't see the open manhole that
the workmen had figured would be
all right at that time of night. It
gets pretty damned cold around 4: A.M.
of a Martian morning, and I
guess the men were warming up
with a little nip at the bar across
the street.</p>

<p>Then&mdash;he was gone.</p>

<p>John just slipped out of my grasp&mdash;<i>Zloomph</i>
and all&mdash;and was gone&mdash;completely
and irrevocably gone.
I even risked a broken neck and
jumped in the manhole after him.
Nothing&mdash;nothing but the smell of
ozone and an echo bouncing crazily
off the walls of the conduit.</p>

<p>"&mdash;is it.&mdash;is it.&mdash;is it.&mdash;is it."</p>

<p>John Smith was gone, so utterly
and completely and tragically gone
it was as if he'd never existed....</p>

<p>Tonight is our last night at <i>The
Space Room</i>. Goon-Face is scowling
again with the icy fury of a
Plutonian monsoon. As Goon-Face
has said, "No beeg feedle, no contract."</p>

<p>Without John, we're notes in a
lost chord.</p>

<p>We've searched everything, in
hospitals, morgues, jails, night clubs,
hotels. We've hounded spaceports
and 'copter terminals. Nowhere, nowhere
is John Smith.</p>

<p>Ziggy, whose two fingers have
healed, has already bowed to what
seems inevitable. He's signed up for
that trip to Neptune's uranium
pits. There's plenty of room for
more volunteers, he tells us. But I
spend my time cussing the guy who
forgot to set the force field at the
other end of the hole and let John
and his <i>Zloomph</i> back into his own
time dimension. I cuss harder when
I think how we were robbed of the
best bass player in the galaxy.</p>

<p>And without a corpus delecti we
can't even sue the city.</p>
